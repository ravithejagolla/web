    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties,composition,abd behavior of matter.It is a  facingnating field that explores the building blocks of the universe</p>
    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p>The <mark>periodic table </mark> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements.Each element is represented by its chemical symbol,such as Fe for iron,H for hydrogen,and O for oxygen.Elements are classifiend into group and periods based on thier properties.
    </p>
    <h3>Chemcal Equations</h3>
    <p>chemical reactions are represented using <i>chemical equations.</i> Here's example of a <i>chemical reactions</i></p>
    <p>2H<sub>2</sub> +O<sub>2</sub> +2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
    <p>This equations represents the reaction between hydromgen gas<i>(H<sub>2</sub>)</i> and oxygen gas<i>(O<sub>2</sub>)</i>to form water <i>(H<sub>2</sub>O).</i></p>
    <h4>Importtant Concepts</h4>
    <p>stoichiomestry is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.</p>
    <p><sub>subscripts</sub>indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>superscripts</sup>represent changes or the number of atoms in an ion</p>
    <h5>conclution</h5>
    <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.</p>
